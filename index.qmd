<!-- <div style="text-align: justify">  -->
I currently work as an ML Engineer at Bosch Global Software Technologies, focusing on poles and boom gates detection for <a href="https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/company/current-news/bosch-and-cariad-develop-automated-driving-functions/" target="_blank">ADAS system in autonomous vehicles</a>. My role involves designing pipelines for data preparation, network training, and enhancing object detection accuracy across different camera types. Previously, as an MLOps Intern at Bosch, I worked on improving traffic light detection for underrepresented classes and streamlined ML pipelines using Azure ML.

With hands-on experience in AI/ML tools, I've contributed to real-world projects, such as autonomous driving, enhancing various ADAS applications. My interests lie broadly in deep learning and natural language processing, and I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex challenges and creating impactful solutions.
